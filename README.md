## üéØ About

The goal was to code a functional website with beautifull animation and learn the technologies on the way. The whole site is inspired from netflix design and i have taken many references and code examples from other github repos. <br/> <br/>

I have added a very small admin panel with a few functionality, integrated login to learn express and database. There is nothing fancy. <br/>
